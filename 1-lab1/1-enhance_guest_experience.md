# OCI Generative AI Workshop: Enhance Guest Experience in Hospitality

## Introduction

This lab focuses on how hotels can enhance guest experiences using **OCI Generative AI**.  
You will step into the shoes of Maria, the General Manager of the Grand Plaza Hotel in Ho Chi Minh City, who receives multilingual reviews daily. With AI, you will learn to summarize reviews, analyze guest sentiment, and translate feedback into English helping managers act quickly and effectively.

Estimated Time: 15–20 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will:

- Use OCI Generative AI to **summarize reviews** in their original language.
- **Analyze sentiment** (Positive, Negative, or Neutral).
- **Translate reviews** into English for hotel management.
- Understand how AI improves **response times**, **guest satisfaction**, and **revenue**.

### Dataset

We will use the trimmed multi-language TripAdvisor Hotel Reviews dataset from [Zenodo / NIAID ](https://data.niaid.nih.gov/resources?id=zenodo_7967493), and a trimmed CSV version of the dataset is also provided in the repository.

Estimated Time:  15-20 minutes
