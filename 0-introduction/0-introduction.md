# Workshop: Enhance Guest Experience with OCI Generative AI

This workshop focuses on using **OCI Generative AI services** to enhance guest experiences and streamline hotel operations.  

You will assume the role of Maria, the General Manager of a hotel, who receives daily multilingual reviews from guests. The workshop will guide you on how to leverage AI to:  
- Summarize reviews  
- Analyze guest sentiment  
- Translate feedback into English 

This enables quick and effective responses that improve guest satisfaction. The workshop is divided into two parts:

### **Lab 1: Enhance Guest Experience with OCI Generative AI**

In this lab, you will:  
- Use the OCI Generative AI Playground. 
- Work with a sample non-English review.  
- Summarize it, analyze its sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral), and translate it into English.  

This task demonstrates how AI saves time while improving accuracy** and scalability in handling guest reviews.

### **Lab 2:** 
**(a) Build an Agentic Hotel Concierge**. 

In this lab, you will:  
- Build a full-fledged AI Concierge using the OCI Generative AI Agent Development Kit (ADK).  
- Create a Knowledge Base from a dataset of guest reviews to enable Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).  
- Enable the concierge to identify patterns and respond to queries about the entire guest feedback knowledge base.  

         
**(b) Build a Data-Driven Concierge to Solve Problems in Real Time with OCI ADK**

In this lab, you will: 
- Extend the agent with custom tools (e.g., web search), allowing it to provide proactive solutions by combining historical insights with real-time context.  

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will learn how to:  

-  Use OCI Generative AI to summarize reviews in their original language  
-  Analyze sentiment (Positive, Negative, or Neutral) of guest feedback  
-  Translate reviews into English for hotel management  
-  Create a Knowledge Base in OCI Generative AI Agents using guest reviews  
-  Build an AI Concierge Agent with RAG capabilities  
-  Extend the agent with custom tools (web search) using the OCI Generative AI Agent Development Kit (ADK)  
-  Understand how AI improves response times, guest satisfaction, and revenue

## Task1: Explore the Foundations


### **What is Generative AI?** 

Generative AI enables users to quickly generate new content based on a variety of inputs. Inputs and outputs to these models can include text, images, sounds, animation, 3D models, and other types of data.  


### **What is a GenAI Agent?**

A Generative AI (GenAI) agent is an intelligent assistant powered by large language models that can understand natural language, reason, and take actions. In Oracle Cloud, GenAI agents can be embedded into applications to answer questions, recommend content, automate tasks, and interact with users naturally.
